# ROBOTARM
This project is the creation of a robot arm using servo motors and driving the arm using Mediapipe.

## File Explanations: 

### Ones I wrote:
functions.js - my functions that are being referenced
sketch.js - the p5 code I wrote for hand-positioning (main file)
sketch.justdragging.js - a test for the servos, it's just dragging the screen, and not mediapipe
style.css
index.html - main html file that runs the page
p5jsOutputServoPCA - the arduino code (main file)

### Ones I imported:
cameraUtils.js - for mediapipe, controls the camera
MediaPipeHands.js - files for mediapipe hand detection
mp-hands.js - the direct code from Google (the whole model)
p5.js - depricated, the run code for p5
p5.min.js - the p5 I'm using
serialFunctions.js - the way the code talks to arduino
server.py - how I run the server locally
